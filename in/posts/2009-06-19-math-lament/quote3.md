In place of a natural problem context in which students can make decisions
about what they want their words to mean, and what notions they wish to
codify, they are instead subjected to an endless sequence of unmotivated and
a priori "definitions." The curriculum is obsessed with jargon and
nomenclature, seemingly for no other purpose than to provide teachers with
something to test the students on. No mathematician in the world would bother
making these senseless distinctions: 2 1/2 is a "mixed number," while 5/2 is
an "improper fraction. " Theyâ€™re *equal* for crying out loud. They are the
same exact numbers, and have the same exact properties. Who uses such words
outside of fourth grade?
