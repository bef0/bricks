What is happening is the systematic undermining of the student’s intuition. A
proof, that is, a mathematical argument, is a work of fiction, a poem. Its
goal is to *satisfy*. A beautiful proof should explain, and it should explain
clearly, deeply, and elegantly. A well-written, well-crafted argument should
feel like a splash of cool water, and be a beacon of light— it should refresh
the spirit and illuminate the mind. And it should be *charming*.

There is nothing charming about what passes for proof in geometry class.
Students are presented a rigid and dogmatic format in which their so-called
"proofs" are to be conducted— a format as unnecessary and inappropriate as
insisting that children who wish to plant a garden refer to their flowers by
genus and species.
