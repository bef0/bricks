By removing the creative process and leaving only the results of that
process, you virtually guarantee that no one will have any real engagement
with the subject. It is like *saying* that Michelangelo created a beautiful
sculpture, without letting me *see* it. How am I supposed to be inspired by
that? (And of course it’s actually much worse than this— at least it’s
understood that there is an art of sculpture that I am being prevented from
appreciating).

By concentrating on *what*, and leaving out *why*, mathematics is reduced to
an empty shell. The art is not in the "truth" but in the explanation, the
argument. It is the argument itself which gives the truth its context, and
determines what is really being said and meant. Mathematics is *the art of
explanation*. If you deny students the opportunity to engage in this
activity— to pose their own problems, make their own conjectures and
discoveries, to be wrong, to be creatively frustrated, to have an
inspiration, and to cobble together their own explanations and proofs— you
deny them mathematics itself. So no, I’m not complaining about the presence
of facts and formulas in our mathematics classes, I’m complaining about the
lack of *mathematics* in our mathematics classes.
