## Philosophy

*Compose*. Avoid class extension. Be wary of frameworks that limit composition.

*Test* when testing helps. Test to shorten the feedback loop and to relieve
anxiety.

Favor *immutable* types and *pure functions*. Mix functional and imperative 
styles.

*Simplicity* in everything awaits discovery. Time producing less code is well 
spent.

*Commit quality* is as important as code quality. Write short diffs and long 
messages.

Never wear shoes without a compelling reason.



## Languages

### Scala

I began using Scala in 2012 for a [3D animation][vine] project, and it quickly 
became my favorite and most productive language. Having a lot of fun with
[Project Euler][project-euler]. In 2013 I built an Akka-based service to manage 
OCR processes for a large document database, and started working on an open 
database of [Georgia salary data][georgia] using the Play framework.

### Haskell

I'm learning! Currently converting my [Project Euler][project-euler] Scala
solutions into Haskell.

### Java

I started with Java in 2005 and since have worked extensively with
Servlet-based web applications at GTRI. Since adopting Scala, I have lost 
patience with Java's inadequacies. One of my projects in grad school was adding
[row-level mandatory access control to H2][h2]. Graphics projects:
[3D sculpting][spray], [circle-packing][packing-game],
[spring physics simulation][delaunay].

### Javascript

My JavaScript knowledge comes from working with webapps at GTRI since 2007 and 
various hobby web projects. Some silly experiments with [canvas][spiral] and
[SVG animation][catgirl].

### Python

I've dabbled with Python in small projects: an
[audio synthesizer][keyconstraint], a presence notification system using an
[IR temperature sensor][awareoffice], web scraping tools for Georgia Tech 
services [Oscar][grouch] and [T-Square][tcube-python].

### C/C++

I am mildly capable with C/C++, mostly from school work:
[LLVM extensions][cs6241], a Linux kernel module.

### PHP

I used PHP for my first web application in 2003 and have revisited it for small
projects since then. I have no fondness for it.
[Web service for scraped T-Square data][tcube-php], a trivial
[intro databases][CS-4400] class project.
